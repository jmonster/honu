Stylist submits blocks of availability
  - startsAt
  - endsAt
  - repeats?
    * daily
    * weekly

UI wise, they pick a day off a calendar. It lists all blocks for that day -- either specifically, one-off for that day ... or a repeating event that happens to fall on that day.

problem: they have a repeating event that they want to disable for one day. fuck.

so regardless of using google cal or not i face the same dillema: a stylist can delete a huge chunk of time and trigger tons of appointments to become fucked without a stylist. but you can easily trigger the same problem with gcal. So, when that happens I can trigger having the appt rescheduled to another appointment. Everytime a stylist adds new availability I can attempt to assign any unassigned appointments to them. And then we can schedule an email to be sent for any unassigned appointments when itâ€™s X hours/days before the appointment. When we get *very* close and no ones on the roster, we cancel the appointment
